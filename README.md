- 👋 Hi, I’m @SarahStyps
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D modeling, architecture, drawing, bringing ideas to life
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blender and the workflows for game design
- 💞️ I’m currently collaborating with some friends on a sci-fi jrpg project!
- 📫 How to reach me ... don't. I don't think I have much to share at this point anyway~
